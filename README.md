# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:
The purpose of PyBer_Analysis, to create and annotate charts that visualize all the rideshare data from January to early May of 2019 for the CEO, V. Isualize.

 During the analysis following were learned and applied in the rideshare data visulization:
  * Using Matplotlib I was able to learn and plot line, bar, scatter, bubble, pie, and box-and-whisker.
  * Add and modify features of Matplotlib charts.
  * Add error bars to line and bar charts.
  * Determine mean, median, and mode using Pandas, NumPy, and SciPy statistics.

I was able to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type.  Also, using Pandas and Matplotlib, I have create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city types.


## Results:

The differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
